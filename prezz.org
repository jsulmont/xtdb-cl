#+title: *  Common Lisp for Clojure Developers
** Key Points for Discussion
*** Resource Efficiency of Common Lisp vs. JVM
    - Emphasize the /comparative lightness of Common Lisp/ in terms of resource usage (memory, processing power) compared to the JVM.
    - Discuss the /efficiency gained from Common Lisp's/ ability to work closer to the hardware, akin to C.
*** Historical Context and Evolution
    - Provide a /brief history of JVM's emergence/ and its initial positioning as a counter to Microsoft's dominance.
    - Highlight how the landscape has evolved, with modern emphases on /containerization, microservices, and the lean and mean approach/.
*** Green Computing and Energy Efficiency
    - Address the /growing importance of energy-efficient computing/ in tackling climate change.
    - Argue how /lighter, more efficient languages like Common Lisp/ could play a role in this green computing era.
*** Comparing Clojure and Common Lisp
    - Acknowledge the /strengths of Clojure/, especially its popularity on the JVM.
    - Contrast this with the /potential resurgence of Common Lisp/, leveraging its efficiency.
    - Mention the /syntactic similarities/ and shared philosophy between Clojure and Common Lisp.
*** Practical Applications and Use Cases
    - Provide examples where /Common Lisp's characteristics/ make it particularly suitable for current and future tech stacks.
    - Discuss /real-world scenarios/ where efficiency and low-level programming capabilities are crucial.
*** Engage with the Audience's Background
    - Draw parallels and contrasts in a way that /respects the expertise of Clojure developers/.
    - Use examples or demonstrations that resonate with their experiences.
*** Future Trends
    - Speculate on /future trends in software development/, especially regarding sustainability.
    - Suggest how languages like Common Lisp could see a /resurgence in popularity/ as the industry shifts focus.
** Conclusion
    - The key to a successful presentation is not only providing information but also engaging with your audience's interests and background.
    - Showing respect for Clojure while highlighting the potential and advantages of Common Lisp, especially in the context of green computing, could make for a very impactful presentation.
